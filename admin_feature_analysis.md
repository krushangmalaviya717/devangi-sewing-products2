## 🎯 Recommended Implementation Order

> [!IMPORTANT]
> આ features ને order-wise implement કરો — પહેલા security, પછી business-critical, પછી nice-to-have

### Phase 1 — Security & Essentials (1-2 days)
1. 🔐 **Admin Login** — without this, anyone can access admin
2. 📦 **Stock Management** — "Out of Stock" functionality
3. 📊 **Export Orders to CSV**

### Phase 2 — Business Growth (2-3 days)
4. 🎟️ **Coupon/Discount System**
5. 🚚 **Shipping Configuration**
6. 💰 **GST/Tax Settings**
7. 🔔 **Order Notifications** (Sound + Badge)

### Phase 3 — Professional Polish (2-3 days)
8. 📱 **WhatsApp Notification**
9. 📈 **Reports Page**
10. ⚙️ **Store Settings Page**
11. 📧 **Email Templates**

### Phase 4 — Advanced Features (Optional)
12. ↩️ Returns/Refunds
13. 📋 Product Import/Export
14. 🏷️ Product Variants
15. 👥 Staff Roles

---

> [!TIP]
> **Admin Login** સૌથી પહેલા implement કરો — currently `/admin/` URL કોઈ પણ access કરી શકે, which is a **major security risk** for a real store!
